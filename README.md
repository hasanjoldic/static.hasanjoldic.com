The purpose of this project is to help with serving static files.

Instead of writing links to our cloud object storage (S3 bucket of Digitalocean Spaces) like:

`https://enki.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/Advanced%20Algorithms%20and%20Data%20Structures.pdf`,

we would put our static server as the host like:

`https://static.hasanjoldic.com/Advanced%20Algorithms%20and%20Data%20Structures.pdf`.
